## Work
Most recently, I was a software developer at MIT Technology Review, where I helped rebuild their frontend and modernize engineering practices. I'm currently looking for opportunities in the greater Boston and Seattle areas, either doing front end or full stack web development. I'm open to both full-time and part time positions, colocated or remote.

## About Me
My name is Daniel Jay Hartman. I live in the lovely City of Somerville, MA.

I was born in Singapore, to a Filipina mother and American father. I've lived in the greater Boston area since 2010.

In May 2015, I graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Interactive Media. At school I developed interests in web development, programming languages, design, usability engineering, information visualization and computer graphics.
