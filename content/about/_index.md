My name is Daniel Jay Hartman. My friends call me DJ.

Occasionally there may be other topics but for the most part this is a technical blog where I will post things I've been learning for fun or profit.

If you're not a robot or a recruiter, feel free to [get in touch](/contact/).

Thanks for stopping by.
