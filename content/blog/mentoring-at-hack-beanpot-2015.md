I'm mentoring this year atÂ [Hackbeanpot 2015](http://hackbeanpot.com/). Last year I participated and I was inspired by some of the things that first-time atendees. While I'm happy to help anyone with things like Javascript (in particular I'm using d3 a lot in class right now), Ruby and various frameworks (no not JUST rails), I'd really love to help you with the basics, from HTML/CSS/JS, git, bash and the command line, hosting your first website.

So say hi if you have a question or just wanna chat.
