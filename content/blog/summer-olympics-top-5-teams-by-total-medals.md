I've been using [d3](http://www.d3js.org/) a lot this semester. This is the first in a series of [blocks](http://www.bl.ocks.org/) that I'm going to post of homework and class exercises from my ARTG 5300: Vizualisation Technologies class. [This assignment](https://github.com/Siqister/ARTG5330_AS_3_A) introduced the class to the Enter/Update/Exit pattern.

If you know d3 and you want to publish a block, read Mike Bostock's [Let's Make A Block](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/). If you're getting started and having trouble with Enter/Exit/Update, [Thinking With Joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/) is a good starting point.
