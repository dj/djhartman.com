title: Polylinear Color Scale Key

Link: [D3 Polylinear Color Scale Key Example](http://bl.ocks.org/dj/ddc0adc41f590981d477)

Despite D3's plethora of examples, I was unable to find an example of this exact type of legend for [Boston Maps](http://hartman.dj/boston/). This type of key is useful for displaying divergent color scales where you want to demonstrate deviations from a meaningful midpoint.
