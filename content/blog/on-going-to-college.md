title: On Going to College

Advice I wish I could go back in time and give to 17-year-old me. Your mileage may vary.

* Don't rely on people who have a vested interest in you enrolling in their institution to educate you about debt. Do it yourself.
* Prioritize your time between classes. You will make mistakes, but stay focused on the classes that matter most to you. Sometimes, you just have to do what you can to get through a class so that you can focus on another class.
* Above all else, prioritize your long term health and wellbeing. You always have time to get some exercise, eat regularly and sleep if you make it a priority.
* Getting up early is awesome. You're always being more alert and prepared than everyone else. Staying up late is overrated.
* Prioritize people who put their time in you.
* Don't compare yourself to other people, especially at school. You have no idea what paths have brought both of you here, and can't meaningfully compare the two.
* Don't be afraid to change your major. It's a lot less painful than getting a college degree you don't want.
* Celebrate the little things, five years is a long time to delay gratification.
