title: 'Bye, Twitter'
---
A couple months ago, I removed Twitter from my phone and stopped checking the site, for the most part. I'm not looking for applause, just looking to share some thoughts I've had since then.

* I still hear about what goes on #onhere, but just slightly later when the blogosphere starts writing about it.
* I feel less cynically about "people" in the abstract. I still keep up with heavy topics, but in general my view of humanity is less extreme and more... human. Individuals are capable of great and terrible things. Social media in general tends towards presenting people exclusively at their best and at their worst.
* Throwing a tweet or two in an article feels like equivalent of cable news'["some people say"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYA9ufivbDw).
* I've long been against journalists using Twitter as a proxy for "public opinion," on most issues, given the[demographics of Twitter](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/). At it's best, Twitter is a great way to explore other's experiences and perspectives. At it's worst, it's a megaphone for the elite, the media class, and of course, #brands.
* Did I mention #brands? I still get lots of #branded #content on Facebook, but it's a lot easier to filter out people who share that stuff. I can even filter out links from certain domains, like Elite Daily or Business Insider!
* Goes without saying, but it's reduced the amount of time I spend mindlessly, anxiously scrolling a feed.

I'm [waiting for Twitter to email me my archive](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive)and then probably[deleting almost everything from Twitter](https://github.com/jmathai/amnesia). I used to feel like it was an important place where conversations took place that wouldn't take place anywhere else, but now I'm no longer convinced that it isn't[a lost cause](http://degoes.net/articles/fuck-twitter).

When [Pokémon Go came out and looked like it was about to pass Twitter in daily active users](https://192.241.151.94/bye-twitter/), it made Twitter seem smaller and more insular than ever. I see parallels between the way because pundits talk about Pokémon Go and Twitter now as if they have["taken over the world,"](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-pokemon-go-gps-jones-ae-0717-20160714-column.html)when their real demographics are much not "universal" but affluent, urban, American, and white.

For now, I'm going back to RSS and hoping that something better eventually comes along. I have no idea what that may look like, but I wonder if it's already being built.
